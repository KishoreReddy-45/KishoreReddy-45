#A list is a fundamental data structure in programming that allows you to store a collection of items. 
#Lists are ordered and can contain elements of various data types, such as numbers, strings, and objects.


students_names = ["kishore", "Reddy", "Ramu", "Guru", "Rohit"]

#since lists are mutable to add the variable to the list use the function keyword "append".

students_names.append("Raghu")
print(students_names)
print(len(students_names))


#tuple
#A tuple is a data structure similar to a list, but unlike lists, tuples are immutable, meaning their contents cannot be changed after creation. 
#Tuples are typically used for grouping related data.

students_names = ("kishore", "Reddy", "Ramu", "Guru", "Rohit")
print(students_names)
